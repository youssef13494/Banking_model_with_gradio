# My New Project

This project is a **deployment of a machine learning model**, or more precisely, a full **pipeline** that was developed to predict customer churn. 

The model takes several inputs (such as credit score, age, balance, and other financial indicators) and determines whether a customer is likely to churn or not. 

Within this pipeline, a **Random Forest classifier** was used to build the prediction model, leveraging its capability to handle complex relationships between features effectively.

The project covers the following:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature engineering, and scaling.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**: Building the Random Forest model and validating its performance.
- **Deployment**: Making the model accessible for real-time predictions through a deployed service.

This pipeline ensures efficient prediction and can be easily integrated into banking or financial applications to identify customers at risk of churn proactively.
